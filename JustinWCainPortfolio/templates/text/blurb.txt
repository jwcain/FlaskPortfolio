Hi, I am Justin! I am a Michigan Technological University graduate with a B.S. in Software Engineering and an aspiration to work on projects that have a meaningful impact on its users, either as media experiences or as usefool tools! You can find some example projects outlined below, and a link to my resume above. As an avid baker, you can also find some of my recipes below!

My first three years post-grad where working with Sonalysts on BlackHorizon, a serious-game/training simulator for AirFore and SpaceForce to learn orbital mechanics and practice potential satellite operations. I worked on the projectâ€™s software architecture, built the project for iOS/Android/Desktop, and worked on custom developer tools for the team to speed up development.

I worked for three years in the Husky Game Development Enterprise at MTU. In my second year, I served as Vice President of Operations within the enterprise. As VPO, I managed our weekly general meetings which usually involved lecturing on relevant game development topics.

I was awarded a scholarship by my enterprise to attend GDC2018.

In the summer of 2018, I had an internship with a startup game studio, Coney Dog Games.
